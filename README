There are a few existing tap room / brewery maps of Minneapolis.
http://www.minnehahamedia.com/gw/twin_cities_beer/
http://heavytable.com/minneapolis-st-paul-tap-room-directory/

A printed map is too soon out od date. Heavy Table is a nice resource
but lacks a map where a user can easil see what venues are near his location
or destination

TapMap will aim to be an up-to-date repository of tap rooms in Minnesota
that is plotted on a routable "slippy" map.
